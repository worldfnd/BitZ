//! NEON kernels for `GF(2^128)`.
//!
//! `pmull` does a 64x64 carryless multiply in one instruction — all of
//! [`super::portable::clmul64`] in a few cycles. Everything here is the
//! portable pipeline with that substitution, held in vector registers so no
//! product crosses into the general-purpose file mid-multiply.
//!
//! `pmull` is an ARM crypto extension, not baseline NEON, so the gate is
//! `aes`, not `neon`. Every intrinsic call below is sound on that basis: the
//! module compiles only with the feature enabled crate-wide.
