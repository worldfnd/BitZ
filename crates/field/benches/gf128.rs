//! Timings for the patterns the prover spends its time in.
//!
//! Run with `cargo bench -p field --bench gf128`. Divan drives the sampling;
//! sample counts and time budgets are tunable through `DIVAN_*` environment
//! variables.
//!
//! The operand arrays are 16 KiB, so a pair of them stays in L1 and what is
//! measured is arithmetic rather than the memory system.
//!
//! The header reports which kernel and which instructions the build selected.
//! Both are silent: `pmull` needs the `aes` target feature and the three-way
//! `eor3` needs `sha3`, and `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` enables neither by
//! default. Dropping `eor3` alone costs about a third of the multiply.
